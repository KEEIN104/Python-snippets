#SUQUENCE AND SERIES OF REAL NUMBERS

#Defined as:
	#independent variable (X-axis): N (natural numbers)
	#Dependent variable (Y-axis): R (real numbers)

#Convergence if:
	#A limiting NUMBER('R-L')		|--Y-axis
	#for (epsilon > 0) around R-L 	|--Y-axis	/
		# Present a NUMBER('N-0') 		|--X-axis
	#such that, N >= 'N-0' => |'R-N' - 'R-L'| < epsilon

	#'R-L' is the Limit or the Convergence point
	#'R-L' may not be present in the sequence

	#else DIVERGRNT

#Bounded if:
	#a number M --Y-axis
	#and 'R-N' <= M; for all N

Theorem:
(for sequence)
Convergent => Bounded;
converse is not true

#Monotonic:

	Theorem:
